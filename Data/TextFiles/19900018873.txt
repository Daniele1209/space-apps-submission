introduction
solar particle events spes have been investigated since the late s
for possible effects on the middle atmosphere solar protons from spes produce
ionizations dissociations dissociative ionizations and excitations in the
middle atmosphere either directly or through a photochemical sequence both ho x
h oh hoz and nox n no noz are produced as well these hox and no x
constituents are important because they can lead to the destruction of ozone
most of these investigations have been primarily focused on the effects of spes
on ozone however a few have been related to the effects of spes on odd nitrogen
n no no no n hnoz hono z and ciono constituents
the spes are good tests for model validation because the large
perturbations to the atmosphere associated with spes are confined to high
latitudes last only for days to months and are easily distinguished in
satellite data this allows the comparison of measurements with a wide variety
of models ranging from simple point models to twodimensional models
ozone depletions have been observed during and after nine separate spes
over the past two solar cycles heath et al mcpeters et al thomas
et al solomon et al mcpeters and jackman spes have also
been observed to increase no during one spe mcpeters 
the production of hox and nox and their subsequent effects on ozone can
also be computed using energy deposition and photochemical models we discuss
the effects of speproduced no x species on the odd nitrogen noy abundance of
the middle atmosphere as well as the speproduced longterm effects on ozone
the influence of hox species on ozone has been discussed in other papers eg
solomon et al jackman and mcpeters and will not be repeated here
odd nitrogen noy variance due to spes
the production of noy species by spes has been predicted since the mid
s crutzen et al recently a satellite measurement mcpeters
was made of the no increase after a major spe july this measured
no increase was in good agreement with our predicted no increase computed

with a i
grid spacing it was assumed that n atoms are produced per ion
pair in this model computation the spe production of n atoms was only input
at geomagnetic latitudes above see jackman and meade for an
explanation
the twodimensional model was run to an annual equilibrium condition in
which the seasonal values of constituents repeat yearly the model was then run
for years from through and investigated for changes for all model
runs in this investigation the ultraviolet flux was not allowed to vary with the
solar cycle
figure la illustrates the variability of noy at mb km and n
over the year period note that noy can vary dramatically after an spe
especially after the august spe but the noy values generally return to
their ambient levels to months after the event the noy seems to be affected
only by those spes which have an ion pair production over about i ion pairs
cm sec this is not a strict rule as the time of year and therefore the
ambient noy amount help determine the magnitude of the noy change at a certain
level see jackman and meade for further discussion some downflux of noy
from the spes mesospherlc production of noy is also associated with the spes and
is important during certain seasons late fall winter and early spring this
downflux can also influence the amount of noy in the upper stratosphere
figure la as well as our analysis of noy at other altitudes and latitudes
indicate that the noy produced by spes over solar cycle time periods does not
build up but can be important at high latitudes on seasonal timescales this
result is not surprlzlng given the small fraction of the annual odd nitrogen
budget that was computed by jackman et al to result from spes the
majority of the annual production of odd nitrogen is a result of nitrous oxide
oxidation and was recently computed jackman et al to be x no
molecules per year the largest production of no molecules from spes was in theyear at the level of x no molecules per year only of the
nitrous oxide source the production of no molecules from spes in other major
speactive years is typically half or less than that computed for 
longterm ozone variance due to spes
figure ib illustrates the variability of ozone at mb km and n
over the year period the ozone decreases are directly correlated with the
noy increases presented in figure la
the percentage change in modeled ozone as a result of the august spe
is given in figure at two latitudes the latitudes in the northern hemisphere
nh at n figure a and n figure b indicate a larger ozone depletion
at n than at n other latitudes investigated from our model results show
a similar behavior with the larger ozone depletions being associated with the
higher latitudes this behavior was also observed in the buv ozone data jackman
and mcpeters the magnitude of the depletion observed in the buv dataset
was similar to that predicted by the model computation for example about a
maximum ozone depletion was observed between and n and about a 
maximum ozone depletion was observed between and n
our model results at s not shown indicates over a ozone depletion
but the model at n indicates a i depletion in the time period to 
days after the spe implying a large hemispheric difference in the level of ozone
depletion maeda and heath showed that the sh did experience a
larger ozone loss than did the nh speproduced noy in winter has a far greater
effect on ambient noy amounts and therefore on ozone levels than does spe
produced noy in summer see jackman and meade for more discussion on spe
effects on noy amounts
discussion and conclusions
model computations indicate fairly good agreement with ozone data for the
speinduced ozone depletion caused by noy species connected with the august 
spe future studies should include a more detailed intercomparison of the ozone
behavior with altitude latitude and time it would also be useful to compare
these detailed studies with another large spe perhaps one that occurs during
the current solar active period since noy constituents are responsible for over
of the ozone loss in the stratosphere jackman et al it is useful
to validate the noy photochemistry which is used in atmospheric models to predict
ozone amounts
our model computations indicate that noywill not be substantially changed
over a solar cycle by spes the changes are mainly at high latitudes and are
on time scales of several months after which the noy drifts back to its ambient
levels
