introduction
a multiwavelength scanning radiometer has been used to measure the
angular distribution of scattered radiation deep within a cloud layer at discrete
wavelengths between and m the relative angular distribution of the
intensity field at each wavelength is used to determine the similarity parame
ter and hence single scattering albedo of the cloud at that wavelength using
the diffusion domain method in addition to the spectral similarity parame
ter the analysis provides a good estimate of the optical thickness of the cloud
beneath the aircraft in addition to the radiation measurements we obtained
microphysical and thermodynamic measurements from which the expected
similarity parameter spectrum was calculated using accepted values of the re
fractive index of liquid water and the transmission function of water vapor
in this paper we present an analysis of the results obtained for a km
section of clean marine stratocumulus clouds on july these observa
tions were obtained off the coast of california from the university of wash
ington convair ca aircraft as part of the first isccp regional experiment
fire we will present a comparison of the experimentallyderived similar
ity parameter spectrum with that expected theoretically from the cloud drop
let size distribution measured simultaneously from the aircraft the mea
surements and theory are in very close agreement for this case of clean mar
itime clouds

on july the ca flew a tightly coordinated mission with the
er aircraft consisting of continually flying legs of km in length the c
a was primarily making cloud radiation and cloud microphysics mea
surements deep within the cloud layer whereas the er was flying well

measurements obtained inside the clouds between and pdt these measurements were
obtained at a wavelength x im
servations obtained with the cloud absorption radiometer king et al at
m show that the zenith and nadir intensities were quite uniform
within these clouds a careful examination of fig suggests that the data
near the start of the flight line are too optically thin to have a diffusion do
main as evidenced by very low zenith and nadir intensity measurements
furthermore the measurements near and km though probably in a
cloud of sufficient optical thickness to have a diffusion domain were ob
tained too near the cloud top so the zenith measurements were contami
nated by directly transmitted solar radiation
the scaled optical thickness between the aircraft flight level and the base
of the clouds was derived by applying the diffusion domain method to all
scan lines of fig that satisfied the diffusion domain criteria see king et al
for details figure illustrates the optical thickness c as a function of
distance where we converted scaled optical thickness to optical thickness us

tm and derived for the measured cloud droplet size distribution of the 
scan lines presented in fig passed the restrictive selection criteria de
scribed in king et al among those measurements excluded from our
analysis were the optically thin scans at the beginning of the time series and

fig optical thickness beneath the aircraft for all measurements of fig that satisfy the
diffusion domain criteria
relatively low zenith intensity and relatively high nadir intensity correspond
to a region of large optical thickness beneath the aircraft
given the surface reflectivity and optical thickness or scaled optical thick
ness of an individual scan at a specified wavelength the intensity ratio iz 
i is reduced solely to a function of similarity parameter s utilizing
formulas summarized in king et al we were thus able to calculate the
intensity ratio as a function of similarity parameter and match this functional
relationship with the measured intensity ratio to derive a value of the
similarity parameter for a given measurement and wavelength
figure illustrates the similarity parameter as a function of distance for
four wavelengths of the car determined in this manner the similarity pa
rameter s defined as s co g is a function of the asymmetry
factor g and the single scattering albedo c the tendency for the similarity
parameter to decrease with increasing distance especially noticeable at 
and m is due to a modest decrease in the effective radius of the cloud
droplets over this distance and not to a decrease in the absorption content of
the cloud droplets themselves due to the use of a filter wheel to measure the
intensity field in channels diffusion domain measurements were ob
tained in this time interval for between and scans depending on filter
position in contrast to for the first seven simultaneously sampled chan

figure illustrates the mean and standard deviation of the spectral simi

measurements on july although the conversion from s to is not
unique due to the moderate spectral variation of g we have provided a sin
gle scattering albedo scale in this figure as a matter of convenience this scale
shown on the righthand side of fig is strictly applicable at k tm
based on profile ascents and descents following these measurements the stra
tocumulus cloud layer was determined to be m thick with a cloud base at
m
in addition to the experimental results obtained using the car fig il
lustrates calculations of the similarity parameter as a function of wavelength
for a cloud composed of water droplets only solid curve and droplets plus
saturated vapor at c dashed curve the water droplet computations
were based on a combination of mie theory and complex angular momentum
theory nussenzveig and wiscombe applied to the measured cloud
droplet size distribution the water vapor computations on the other hand
were based on assuming the cloud to be composed of saturated vapor and ap
plying the necessary pressure and temperature scaling to obtain an equivalent
absorber amount w g cm the water vapor transmission functions
were then computed for this cloud layer at a resolution of cm using

the very close agreement between the measurements and theory shows
that in this case the absorption of solar radiation by the clouds can be ac
counted for largely by the droplets and that the large drops drizzle did not
produce significant anomalous absorption based on these results we are
forced to conclude that anomalous absorption as discussed by twomey
davies et al and stephens and tsay was not significant in
the marine stratocumulus clouds that we sampled on julyreferences
