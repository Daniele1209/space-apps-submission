introduction
main components of corpuscular radiation contributing to
energy deposition ed in ev cmss i in the atmosphere 
km are cosmic ray nuclei cr galactic and solar and high
energy electrons hee mainly of magnetospheric origin
cosmic ray interaction in atmosphere
two types of interactions with nuclei of air constituents are
important inelastic nuclear interactions and coulomb collisions
figure i shows the energy losses dedx range h in height scale
and probability of inelastic nuclear interaction for proton in air
nuclear data from janni 
nuclear interactions lead to the decrease of initial cr flux
due to fragmentation of nuclei and to the creation of new
corpuscular particles and electromagnetic radiation above km
i g cm less than protons he and of fe nuclei
had their first nuclear interaction this fraction increases with
decrease of h and below n km nuclear interactions must be
included for ed calculations
relations between the parent cr nuclei and their secondary
products which again undergo nuclear interactions coulomb
collisions and decay are complicated in datta et al it
is recognized that gamma rays constitute the resultant component
from different decay channels from the knowledge of vray profile
and absorption coefficient of vrays in atmosphere the ion
production rate pr edev was predicted which for middle
latitude gave good agreement with direct pr measurement below 
km figure illustrates profile of pr down to io km for low
latitudes the main sources of pr variability are atmospheric
density variations eg seasonal
the coulomb collisions of cr nuclei in atmosphere lead to
direct ionization the mean relative ionization energy loss
dedx is given by bethebloch formula bbf velinov et al
used bbf for pr computations of cr above km where
coulomb collisions are dominant figure shows profiles of pr
due to dependence in dedx heavy cr nuclei contribute
significantly to the total pr by ionization cr protons being 
of cr population give of pr while nuclei z only of
cr give of total production for estimation of pr by
cr figure i may be used
three main factors control the ed of cr not assuming
meteorological variations geomagnetic filter modulation effects
of cr in heliosphere and solar cr impact
first of them leads to the latitudinal om variations of ed
profiles in real magnetic field accordlng trajectory calculation the approximation r i lzss l being mcilwans
parameter and r rigidity of particle r pze gives realis
tic estimate ofcvertica effective cutoff rigidity sheaet al
this approach does not include fine structure of forbidden
and allowed trajectories around r and nonvertical directions r
c
is changing during geomagnetic storms the approach to this prob 
lem is in fluckiger et al the simplified estimates for
d nt give for variation in pr qq and for
st qq m
m
modulation of cr in solar cycle is the cause of ed variations
by cr at higher latitudes charge state f anomalous ca oxygen up
to mevn is now established to be i mcdonald et alj 
biswas et al thus its rigidity is rather high at 
the pr at h km may be affected by this ca component being
strongly dependent on solarcycle phase these ions can be
stripped by residual atmosphere and become stably trapped blake
variety of solar flare particle energy spectra composition
angular distribution and temporal profile near the earth may lead
to changes in ed of ca at higher latitudes which could be
significant for km
hibh energy electaon deposition
for electrons both angular scattering and energy losses
should be included in calculation of ed in atmosphere walt
scattering on orbital electrons is small in comparison with
that on the nucleus however interactions with orbital electrons
are important for energy losses the angular diffusion leads to
large straggling of penetration depth reached by individual
electrons calculation of electron ed is possible only by
numerical methods for estimation figure show dependence of
stoppingpower both collision ionization scol and radiative
sr and range for electrons h taken from bergea and seltzer
the concept of range for electron is different from that of
protons and it can be used only for rough estimates the relative
fraction of radiative losses increases with energy bremsstrahlung
bs bs photons depositelthe energy by photoeffect and compton
scattering for spectra expe the altitude profile of ed
in atmosphere is on figure taken from berger et a ed
by monoenergetic electrons was examined in crees giving
estimate that only e kev are important below io km
bs of electrons treated theoretically in walt et al
seltzea and berger is used for remote sensing of
electron precipitation from satellites imhof imhof et al
a imhof et al b local measurements of balloons matt
haeus et al and rockets sheldon eta 
vampola and goaney used spectra of locally precipita
ting electrons kev to calculate ed profiles powerlaw
approximation in spectra yields in two maxima the main at 
km where ed is comparable with ed by solar h on day side while
on night side the ionization by electrons is dominating and
secondary peak km due to bs during meagnetospheric substorms
the electron precipitation pattern is drastically changing both
temporaly and in local time eg gotselyuk et al gotse
lyuk et al global distribution of electrons e kev atlow altitudes revealed connection of additional precipitation
zones with manmadeactivity grigoryaent al detailed
global distribution of heewas studied on ohzorsaatellite nagata
et al 
measurementswith good energy resolution showed the finer
structure of electron precipitation preferentially on the night
side electrons with hard spectra kev precipitate in
narrow range of l near plasmapausecontributing thus significantly
to edat km imhofet al electron spectra in inner
belt l 
exhibit strong peaks at kev datlowe
et al thus profile of ed in middle atmosphere especially
in south atlantic anomaly saa could have complicated form
narrow peaks in precipitating electron spectra i kev
within driftloss cone produced by vlf transmitters in inner zone
are reported in imhof b similar conclusion in kev
at outer edge of inner zone is in vampola later study
vampola and adams revealed importance of vlf transmitters
for hee precipitation in inner zone in the slot and outer zone
theoretical approach assuming gyroresonant pitchangle scattering
of electrons with waves both near equator as well as at low
altitudes is well developed now inan neubert et al
an attempt to measure stimulated precipitation of hee by
powerful lf wave emitted from satellite is one of the objectives
for aktivny satellitesubsatellite experiment schevchenko 
tiska et al resonance conditions of measured electrons
kev give for f xo khz the possible precipitation at
l within the drift loss cone near the bounce loss cone
boundary kudela 
trapped electrons at geostationary orbit up to e mev are
present and their intensity is associated with solar cycle
activity baker et al while auroral electron precipitat
ion is located in narrow interval around and may cause
ed increase above km very hee can deposite energy at lower
heights and in broad latitude range baker et al found
significant enhancement of pr at km well above both cr and
extreme uv ed this electron population could be important in
coupling swmagnetosphere variability to the middle atmosphere
compilation of pr in middle atmosphere by different measurements
is presented on figure 
in saa electrons even with higher energies e mev
apparently not connected with above population have significant
flux gusev et al and can conttribute to pr below km
radiative losses are important for them too penetration of
electrons from interplanetary space to high latitudes was studied
by mcdiarmid et al and such hee were used as a sounding
tool for magnetospheric boundary changes and their connection with
imf and sw parameters kuznetsov et al kuznetsov et al
their latitudinal extent is in some cases down to m 
and their flux i cmsister i for e kev could contri
bute to enhanced pr at km q
summary
galactic cr depending on solarcycle phase and latitude are
dominant source of ed by corpuscular radiation below km
below km secondaries must be assumed more accurate treatmentneed assuming of individual he solar flare particles cutoff
rigidities in geomagnetic field and their changes during magneto
spheric disturbances
electrons e kev of magnetospheric origin penetrating to
atmospherecontribute to prbelow kmespecially on night side
high temporal variability localtime dependenceand complicated
energy spectra lead to complicated structure of electron ed
rate
electrons of mev energy found at geostationary orbit pronouncing
relation to solar and geomagnetic activity cause maximum ed at
km
monitoring the global distribution of ed by corpuscular
radiation in middle atmosphere need continuing low altitude
satellite measurements of both hee and xray bs from atmosphere
as well as measurements of energy spectra and charge composition
of he solar flare particles
