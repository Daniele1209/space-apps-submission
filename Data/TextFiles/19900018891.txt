during february near the minimum of the ifyear solar
sunspot cycle after a long period of totally quiet solar activity
r z on most days in january a period of a suddenly enhanced
solar activity occurred in the minimum between solar cycles and
two proton flares were observed during this period a few
other flares various phenomena accompanying proton flares an
extremely severe geomagnetic storm and strong disturbances in the
earths ionosphere were observed in this period of enhanced solar
activity
two active regions appeared on the solar disc region noaa
occurred on the disc between january ii february 
several large flares appeared in this active region the most
important flares two proton flares were observed in this region
february ut imp b and february ut
imp b another large flare occurred in this region on february
ut imp b the second active region noaa 
occurred on the solar disc between february its most
important flare was observed on february ut
the flares in both active regions were associated with
enhancement of solar high energy proton flux which started on 
february of ut the enhancement of the solar proton flux on
february with maximum on february ut and the end
on february is depicted in fig i
associated with the flares the magnetic storm with sudden
commencement had its onset on february ut and attained its
maximum on february kp its development in kp is also
shown in fig i
the sudden enhancement in solar activity in february was
accompanied by strong disturbances in the earths ionosphere sids
and ionospheric storm the highest sid event importance was
observed on february ut two proton flares 
february were folowed by pca events in the lower ionosphere
the strong geomagnetic storm culminating on february caused
a strong ionospheric storm the effects of this storm as observed
by the ionosonde at pruhonice observatory n e are
plotted in fig variations of the critical frequency of the f
layer of the ionosphere from to february are shown in fig 
the positive part of the storm effect began on february forenoon
and at about ut was followed by a sudden decrease of the
critical frequency of the f layer from mhz to mhz while
the virtual heights increased the negative part of the storm
characterized by spread echoes and low critical frequency lasted
until february on february from quite unusual effects
were observed unusually e layer h km foe mhz
higher virtual height and higher frequency than the normal e
layer which may be interpreted as a particle e layer which
appeared on the ionogram at ut fig this effect was
followed by the appearance of a quite extraordinary layer inut with virtual height of about km fig this layer
existed l hour and then droped down and became an es layer type of
a auroral which existed until ut
these effects and type es are quite unusual in our middle
latitudes and were probably connected with strongly increased
auroral activity
the effect of the geomagnetic storm on the lower ionosphere
consisted of two different types the first type observed at high
latitudes consisted in a large increase of electron density
coincident with the geomagnetic storm at midlatitudes we observed
the poststorm effect pse which consisted of the first phase
pse i coincident with the geomagnetic storm and the second
phase observed after the geomagnetic storm pse if for the
detection of poststorm effects caused by the geomagnetic storm
on february we used a absorption measurement given in table

the first phase pse i of the post storm effect started on 
february the maximum of the geomagnetic storm was on february
ap kp and the end of the first phase had pse on 
february pse ii started on february the results for night
time absortpion data in given measuring paths fig indicated
that the first phase of the pse was well developed only for the
northern most measuring path p khz the second
phase of pse ii absorption enhancement on that path decreased very
quickly up to day after pse i end this result indicates a
direct effect in high latitudes rather than midlatitudes on the
other band the results for khz and khz represent a
typical midlatitude case with missing phase i and very well
developed phase if the case of khz is very like the
behaviour of the transitional type normally observed in the
subauroral zone with the transition of the time of the
commencement of the first phase with latitude the effect on 
khz is developed very weakly the existence of the third phase pse
ill after february is not quite clear either this latitude
boundary is in accord with the hypothesis on equatorward expansion
of the auroral zone during geomagnetic storm in early february
