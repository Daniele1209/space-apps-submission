latent heating effects on stratocumulus circulations have been studied successfully with a
ninecxefficient spectral model of twodimensional shallow boussinesq convection
laufersweiler and shirer jas further more realistic investigations are
being performed currently with a larger coefficient spectral model in which the effects of
cloud top radiational cooling and incloud radiational heating are also being represented
because assuming a rigid lid at the inversion base may have affected previous results
significantly we have raised the domain top to include the lower portion of the capping
inversion as in the previous model a uniform cloud base is assumed and latent heating effects
are included implicitly such that the motions in the sub and abovecloud regions are dry
adiabatic and the motions in the cloud region are moist adiabatic the effects of forcing by
radiational heating profiles that are tied to the cloud layer such as the one used by nicholls
ojrms will be investigated as will profiles measured during the fire
experiment
one concern of using truncated spectral models is that the phenomena are so poorly
represented that they can change dramatically as the number of spectral coefficients is increased
the efficacy of the ninecoefficient model results is checked by examining the steady state
solutions of the coefficient model for parameter values used by laufersweiler and shirer
which corresponds to the case of a moderately deep cloud and no capping inversion fig
here the horizontally asymmetric circulation patterns that have narrow downdraft areas and
broad updraft areas are virtually the same as those found in the smaller spectral model fig lb
also captured in the case of weaker heating is an elevated circulation centered at cloud base
fig la thus the results of the smaller model are substantiated
since one of the goals of studying the new model is to represent a more realistic domain
the second test of the model is to investigate whether the steady solutions are suppressed in the
case of an inversion with no cloud the capping inversion should limit the convective
circulations but we do not force this to happen with the imposition of a rigid lid at the inversion
base figure shows the steady solutions for the case of a relatively strong inversion of 
ckin that begins at a height of z t as indicated by the tic for the case when the value of the
rayleigh number is near its critical value fig a the circulations are weak and located in the
subinversion region of the domain for a higher value of the rayleigh number fig b the
circulation has intensified but is still restricted to the subinversion region importantly the
updrafts only penetrate into the inversion by a small amount thus the model is correctly
representing the effects of an inversion by properly suppressing the convection
figures and are the first investigations into the performance of the model when both
the cloud and an inversion are represented figure shows the steady solutions for a weak
inversion having a value of ckin and fig shows the steady solutions for a fairly strong
inversion having a value of ckin the higher value of the inversion strength although
large is still on the order of of the values of the inversion strength that were measured
during fire typically around to cfcm by comparing the figures we observe that the
intensity of the circulation patterns for the weaker inversion is stronger than that for the stronger
inversion however we are concerned that for higher values of the rayleigh number the
circulations penetrate too deeply into the inversion this result may be due to the fact that the
latent heating as represented in this model is warming the flow far more than that found in the
actual boundary layer possibly inclusion of radiative forcing will compensate for this effect
