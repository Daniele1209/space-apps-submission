introduction
humidity variability at the top of the marine boundary layer mbl and
in the free troposphere has been examined using a variety of measurements
taken on and around san nicolas island sni during the fire ifo in july
doppler wind profiler reflectivity recorded at two minute time
resolution has provided the most continuous record and detail of small scale
humidity fluctuations rawinsonde data was available from both an island
site and the research vessel point sur the information extractable from
these sources is somewhat limited due to the frequency of launches day
at sni and day on the point sur some additional data was available from
instrumented aircraft although scheduling flights in the neighborhood of the
island was difficult due to restrictions on the air space other relevant
data was collected at sni near the radar and rawinsonde launch sites a
continuous record of cloud base altitude was logged by a ceilometer doppler
acoustic sounder sodar reflectivity data provided a good record of
inversion height the sodar also monitored turbulent temperature
fluctuations in the mbl a small ground station recorded hourly averages of
solar irradiance and downward longwave irradiance
this paper describes analysis in progress of the various data sets
described above for two adjacent two day periods from ii july to july
the earlier period was chosen because the marine inversion was unusually high
and there was increased frequency of rawinsonde launches at sni the later
period was chosen because of the significant descent with time of an elevated
inversion indicated by the radar data throughout the four day period but
especially in the first half the turbulent humidity structure calculated
from doppler radar reflectivity shows excellent agreement with humidity
profiles evaluated from rawinsonde data
interpretation of doppler radar reflectivity
penn states doppler wind profiler used at sni operates at a frequency
of mhz for fire the pulse width was set at i s to provide the best
possible range resolution while satisfying the receiver bandwidth constraint
the pulse repetition frequency was i hz processing of radar
reflectivity is accomplished in the following manner the complex video of
consecutive pulses are coherently averaged time domain integration a
set of of these integrations is processed by a fast fourier transform
fft to produce one spectrum incoherent averaging is then performed on 
of these variance spectra to produce the two minute averaged spectrum from
which the signalnoise ratio snr is extracted
since radar backscatter occurs in a volume vs defined by the pulse and
beam widths volume reflectivity n replaces the more familiar backscatter
crosssection a where nav the volume reflectivity is related to the
snr by the spectral radar equation vanzandt et al

the backscatter intensity of the radars signal depends on the mean
refractive index gradient existing in the scattering volume therefore the
refractive index structure function parameter c can be written in terms
of the radars volume reflectivity ottersten i

both temperature and humidity fluctuations may contribute to variations
inthe refractive index within the scattering volume in radar studies of
cn at low altitudes the contribution due to temperatzure luctuations is
usually ignored wesley conversion from c to c is then

from for july in this and the following figures time in ours is
measured continuously starting at z on ii july higher values of c
correspond to regions of increased scattering from turbulent humidit
fluctuations in regions of active turbulence the structure function
parameter c for a particular variable x is proportional to the square

where x could be t q or n cu a measure of local turbulence is the
velocity structure function parameter n is the bruntvaisala frequency and
xd is a constant thus c should correlate well with vertical humidity
gradients q
for comparison fig shows q contours gkg derived from rawinsonde
data for the same time period shown in fig i the swath of high aqsz
across the middle of fig is evidence of the mbl inversion height
decreasing from about i m at the beginning of ii july to about m at
the endof july note that the humidity gradients r well correlated
with c except for a period from z to z in which reaches a local
minimu while aqaz approaches its maximum value q
this apparent disagreement with the relationship in can be analyzed
using additional data obtained from the remote sensors located at sni a
record of cloud base measured by the ceilometer schubert et al b is
shown in fig clear sky is depicted by a point at m the period
labeled z to z shows a sharp decrease in cloud base suggesting a period
of strong subsidence which eventually leads to clearing just after z wind
speed contours from merged sodarwind profiler data sets syrett are
shown in fig here the period from z to z is characterized by light
winds and negligible vertical wind shear thus for the period in question
one may conclude that although a strong humidity gradient exists the
mechanisms that would normally generate turbulence in the region of the
gradient such as cloud top entrainment ad vertical wind shear are not
present resulting in lower values of c
