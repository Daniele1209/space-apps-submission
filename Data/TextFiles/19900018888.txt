solar terrestrial researches hove revealed substantial
meaning of nonsteod events on the sun moinl solar flares for
the processes taking place in ionosphere solar flares result in
the numerous consequences account and prediction of which become
necessor in our dogs it is well known that ionospheric
disturbances following solar flares cause strong disturbances in
the ionosphere which severel violate radiosstems
communication navigation etc in the given paper we consider
possibilities of sudden short wave todeouts swf prediction
it was long ago when solar phgsicists came to the conclusion
that solar flares are not the exclusive events of solar activity
but represent a natural phenomenon in the active regions
development rust 
thus sid effects evoked b the sudden increase of
xradiation in the range of a during the flares mo not be
considered as the single phenomena but as o flow of casual
events so the longterm prediction of swf effects occurrence
probobilit me be based on the probabilit characteristics
anolgsis of their occurrence on different phases of solar
activit for a particular time interval at the same time it is
assumed that a slow changing of statistic model parameters in the
solar activit ccle takes place
for solving the problem there were obtained and anolgzed
hgstogroms of swf occurrence frequenc distribution for one
particular do using data on their registration within the world
network of sid monitoring stations for the period of 
published in solar geophysical data 
observation data were processed seporotel for various
phases of solar activity thus the results of and
characterized solar octivit minimum results of and
growth phase results of e solar activit
maximum results of and characterized falloff
phase of solar octivitg
figure gives an example of the experimental data in the
form of hgstograms of n events probabilit distribution n
varies from e to le on a da for solar octivit maximum or
for solar activit minimum hstograms for all solar cgcle phases
are similar the hove maximum at ne with a different maximum
value for various ccle phases of solar activitg the greatest
number of dags without swf effects iee is tpical for solar
activit minimum for this period p for the period of
solar octivit maximum this value is the least p
average value of swf occurrence frequent on o de of solaroctivit minimum is ne but at solar activit moximum n
occurrence of swf effects ma be considered as a rare casual
event so it was quite natural to use poisson distribution for
theoretical description of occurrence frequency after comparison
a great difference between theoretical and experimental
distributions was revealed we ma assume than swf effects are
rare casual events but separate effects are not independent
flare activit on the sun leading to swf occurrence in
ionosphere is a complex multiparametric process depending upon
spatial distribution of active regions on the solar disk upon
magnetic fields of these regions and upon man other parameters
thus it is evident that a model of independent occurrence
polsson model is not adequate to real conditions of swf
occurrence
experimental hgstograms analgsis allows to suggest that
exponential distribution ma be chosen as most suitable
simplified distribution for their description satisfactory
approximation with empiric distributions has been obtained with
the help of superposition of two exponents
approximation expression was obtained for ever phase of
solar cycle and besides coefficients were chosen empiricall
basing on the experimental hystograms

thus approximate analytical expression for swf occurrence
frequent distribution ma be presented in general as follows
pn alepln aexpn 
where coefficients a a and vary with a change of
solar activitg on this base we assume that there ma be link
between parameters of approximate expression and solar
activity index for example relative sunspot number r z or
socalled wolf number
fig shows variation of parameters values a a i 
and r z during st cgcle of solar activity it should be
mentioned that approximate expression parameters are changing in
the cgcle with periodicity tgpical for rz variationsso it is possible to express the coefficients of onolgticol
expression
as a function of sunspot number
a aio zi alt

where
rz rz minr z max r z min 
it should be mentioned that in formulae the values of aio
and ai i for fixed phase of solar activit
cncle remain constant being obtained on the bose o ossemblw
average for everw period
link of opproximote expression porameters with wolf numbers
is determined bw expressions and it is known that nowodoys
sunspots are the most precisel predictable values
characterizing solar activity vitinskiy 
using the prediction of rz values solar geophgsical data
of expressions we obtain parameters of approximate
analytical expression that allow further to calculate n swf
effects occurrence probability on da for o given period
beforehand that is to realize longterm prediction it is
possible as well to give forecasting of expectable overage number
of swf effects in the period of interest
results of control predictions hove shown that statistical
model is satisfactory describing empirical distribution of swf
effects occurrence for various phases of solar activitg or gives
the assessment of average number of effects for a particular
period for example a year in advance the results of longterm
prediction b average values are sttisticall onl slightlw
different from monitoring results
thus our work has shown that the possibilit of longterm
prediction of swf effects occurrence frequency is conditioned b
slow temporal variations of statistic model parameters and by
link of these parameters with sunspot number as well
