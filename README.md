# space-apps-submission
This is my team's project submission for Nasa International Space Apps Challenge 2022

This repository contains a web application built with Next.js and hosted on Netlify that is able to extract keywords from research papers using natural language processing (NLP) models in Python. The application was developed as a submission to the NASA Space Apps Challenge, and aims to provide a user-friendly tool for quickly identifying the key concepts and ideas in research papers.

The application uses a state-of-the-art NLP model trained on a large corpus of research papers to automatically extract keywords from the text of a research paper. The extracted keywords are then displayed to the user, along with a short description of each keyword and its relevance to the research paper.

In addition to keyword extraction, the application also provides a search function that allows users to search for specific keywords across a collection of research papers. This allows users to quickly find research papers that are relevant to their interests and needs.

Overall, this repository is a valuable resource for anyone interested in natural language processing and developing tools for extracting information from research papers. The application is easy to use and provides a convenient way to identify the key ideas in research papers.
