the purpose of this paper isto present a summary of some current work on mea
surement and interpretation ofstratospheric ozone and temperature responses to observed
shortterm solar ultraviolet variations although some studies have yielded provisional
evidence for a nearly inphase ozonesolar cycle relationship they extend at most over
only one or two elevenyear cycles so the statisticalsignificance of the correlations isnot
large similarly the relativelyshort lengths of individual satellitedata setscombined with
the problem of estimating the effectofchanges ininstrument sensitivitydriftduring the
observing period have complicated attempts to inferlongterm or solarcycle ozone trends
the solarrotation and active region development time scaleprovides an alternate time scale
forwhich detailed studies of middle atmospheric ozone and temperature responses tosolar
ultraviolet variabilityare currently possible using available satellitedata setsat tropical
latitudes where planetary wave amplitudes are relativelysmall clear correlative evidence
for the existence of middle atmospheric ozone and temperature responses to shortterm
solar ultraviolet variations has been obtained in recent years gille et al heath

these measurements willultimately allow improved empirical and theoretical calculations
of longerterm solar induced ozone and temperature variations atlow and middle latitudes

 solar backscattered ultraviolet sbuv daily zonal mean profilesand stratosphere and
mesosphere sounder sams gridded retrieved temperature data available from the us
national space science data center in order to characterize variations in solar spectral
irradiance at wavelengths where photodissociation of molecular oxygen isimportant the
flux at nm as measured with the sbuv instrument ischosen to be consistent with
earlierstudies the flux at this wavelength has been found from analyses of sbuv solar
flux data to be representative of shortterm variations throughout the nm range

figure compares the nm solarirradiance time serieswith zonally averaged sbuv
ozone mixing ratios and sams temperatures for the equator at mbar approximately
 km altitude this altitude ischosen because itisintermediate between the locations
of the ozone response maximum about kin and the temperature response maximum
about kin a low latitude isselected because of the increasing seasonal and planetary
wave amplitudes with increasing latitude which increase the diiicultyofdetecting changes
caused by solarultravioletvariations daytoday variations and short gaps between daily
zonal mean temperature ozone and solar ultraviolet time serieswere minimized using a
day running mean and linear interpolation algorithm
the nm flux time seriesischaracterized by a broad maximum corresponding to
the solar activity maximum of and shortterm variations associated with activeregion development and solar rotation the originally measured nm flux data set also
contains a longterm trend ascribable to instrument drift we have therefore employed the
mg ii core ratio of heath and schlesinger to represent changes in the 
nm flux on time scales greater than days the resulting scaled nm flux time series
normalized to a value of w cm s as measured on november decreases by
approximately between solar maximum in and late for comparison
the solar mesosphere explorer satellite has measured a change in monthly mean 
nm flux of approximately between early and early although instrument
error sources are still being evaluated g rottman private communication
the mbar equatorial sams temperature time series bottom panel is charac
terized by semiannual and annual components with superposed shorterterm fluctuations
because of the strong temperature dependences of the reaction rates that determine the
ozone concentration these semiannual and annual temperature variations produce nega
tively correlated ozone variations as shown in the center panel this characteristic em
phasizes the need to consider simultaneous temperature measurements when interpreting
ozone temporal behavior at altitudes and latitudes where photochemical equilibrium is a
reasonable first approximation finally it should be noted that small interannual trends
present in both the sbuv and sams measurements could be due in part to instrument
drift and are not necessarily real
from the amplitudes of seasonal ozone and temperature variations as well as the
possibility of instrument related longterm drifts it is clear from figure that detection
of solar ultraviolet induced ozone or temperature responses on seasonal and longer time
scales from the currently available nimbus data sets would be very difficult on the
other hand as can be seen in the top panel day nm flux variations are as large as
 peaktopeak and are therefore comparable to the probable change in the monthly
mean flux over a solar cycle consequently most recent efforts to detect and characterize
middle atmospheric ozone and temperature responses to solar ultraviolet variations have
concentrated on the solar rotation time scale
in order to isolate temporal variations on time scales comparable to the solar rota
tion period all time series may be detrended by subtracting the day running mean in
each case in order to allow a direct visual comparison of the resulting shortterm 
nm flux deviations with the ozone and temperature deviations figure superposes the
uv time series onto the atmospheric time series positive correlations between equatorial
 mbar ozone variations on this time scale and solar nm flux variations are evident
this is particularly true during intervals of relatively strong and continuous day solar
uv variations such as those occurring in october february mayaugust 
and juneaugust it is apparent from the lower panel of figure that mbar
temperature deviations are not positively correlated with uv deviations at zero lag how
ever a tendency for temperature maxima to occur after uv maxima by days can be
discerned visually in some time intervals particularly october february and
juneaugust 
in order to derive the average lowlatitude ozone or temperature response sensitivity to
observed changes in the nm solar flux crosscorrelation and linear regression methods
have been applied this sensitivity is defined as the percent change in either ozone mixing
ratio or temperature for a change in the nm flux also determined is the phase
lag in days of either ozone or temperature relative to the nm flux in order to test the
reproducibility of the previous results of hood hood and cantrell

figure superposition of the detrended sday running mean removed solar nm
fluxonto the detrended equatorial ozone and temperature time seriesat the mbar level
from hood and cantrelland summarize their results the ozone response is seen to reach a maximum of about
 near the mbar level for a change in the nm flux actual peaktopeak ozone
mixing ratio changes were as large as corresponding to maximum nm flux changes of
 on the day time scale the temperature response maximizes near the stratopause
and amounts to about k for a change in the s nm flux actual peakto
peak temperature changes were as large as k formal error limits for each time interval
represent standard deviations from the mean of separate estimates for the five latitude
zones between s and n as shown in figure ozone response amplitudes and
phase lags derived in these separate analyses are generally in agreement formal error
limits overlap in all cases except for the response amplitude at mbar which is somewhat
larger during interval b than during interval a as shown in figure temperature
response amplitudes and phase lags are also in approximate agreement although formal
error limits are significantly larger for the response amplitudes temperature phase lags
below mbar also appear to be somewhat larger during interval b than during interval
a these response measurements agree well with an independent analysis by keating
et al of the same year time interval
the ozone response measurements of figure are compared to two simulations of
the expected response calculated using radiativephotochemical models the solid lines
show the response amplitude and phase lag calculated by brasseur et al using
a onedimensional time dependent radiative photochemical code this simulation is in
qualitative agreement with the measurements but the amplitude of the calculated ozone
response is noticeably less than the observed response above about mbar it has been
suggested that a part of the difference between the model result and the observed ozone
response is due to the use of diurnally averaged photodissociation rates in the model calcu
lations hood and douglass have reported calculations using a parameterized
perturbationorder radiative photochemical model but using a variable solar zenith range
in the photodissociation calculations that is more appropriate for comparison with the
sbuv measurements the resulting ozone response amplitude and phase lag are shown in
figure as dashed lines the increased photodissociation rate changes result in a higher
amplitude for the ozone response that is more nearly in agreement with the observed
amplitude at levels below about mbar
as noted earlier the monthly mean solar nm flux scaled using the mg ii core
ratio decreases by approximately between solar maximum in and late 
figure adopting this flux variation the same radiative photochemical code used to
produce the dashed line model of figure for the day time scale may be applied in
order to estimate the expected solar cycle variation of ozone mixing ratio at levels between
 and mbar and at equatorial latitudes results show predicted mean ozone mixing
ratio decreases of at mbar at mbar and at mbar for the interval
between solar maximum in and solar minimum in such decreases would be
small in comparison to seasonal variations and would be difficult to detect relative to other
natural sources of variability such as the e chichon volcanic eruption the net change in
the ozone column at low latitudes resulting directly from these upper stratospheric mixing
ratio decreases would be less than 
although radiativephotochemical models can yield an approximate agreement with
the observed ozone responses and phase lags below mbar it is unlikely that the large
discrepancy between observed and theoretically calculated temperature phase lags figure
 can be simulated by such models as previously argued by hood and by
brasseur et al the shortfall of the calculated temperature phase lags resultso
figure sbuv ozone response amplitudes sensitivities and phase lags determined by
linear regression for the indicated time intervals error bars are standard deviations from
the mean for separate regression estimates for five latitude bands centered on the
equator also shown for comparison are two theoretical profiles see the text after

figure same as figure but for sams temperaturefrom the fact that newtonian cooling lifetimes in the upper stratosphere are relatively
short eg about days near mbar schoeberl and strobel conse
quently calculated temperature phase lags for day solar ultraviolet forcing are no more
than days when only radiative heating is considered it therefore appears that more
than a onedimensional model that considers only photochemistry and radiative heating
is needed to provide a complete description of the observed responses at a minimum a
twodimensional model with coupled dynamics may be required
