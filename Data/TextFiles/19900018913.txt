i introduction
the spatial sampling limitations of surface measurement systems
necessitate the use of satellite data for the investigation of largescale
cloud processes understanding the information contained in the satellite
observed radiances however requires a connection between the remotely
sensed cloud properties and those more directly observed within the
troposphere surface measurements taken during the first isccp regional
experiment fire marine stratocumulus intensive field observations ifo
are compared here to cloud properties determined from geostationary
operational environmental satellite goes data in order to determine how
well the island measurements represent larger areas and to verify some of
the satellitemeasured parameters
data
total cloud amounts and visible m topoftheatmosphere cloud
albedos were derived with the hybrid bispectral threshold method hbtm
minnis et al from hourly goeswest data young et al over
two regions between iiw and w and n and n for july 
cloud albedos cloud fractions and integrated cloud liquid water
contents were determined from measurements taken nearly continuously over
san nicolas island fairall et al with a variety of instrumentation
during this same time period san nicolas island sni is located near the
center of the eastwest boundary of two satellite regions results from
both the microwave and solar radiometer cloud liquid water content lwc
measurements are compared to the satellite albedos these preliminary
comparisons match relatively large areal averages to essentially linear
averages of the cloud fields advecting over a fixed point
results and discussion
mean hourly cloud fractions are shown in fig i for the sni and hbtm
results the sni cloud amounts on average are greater than
the hbtm total cloud amounts the diurnal variations are similar with early
morning maxima and late afternoon or evening minima the hbtm diurnal
range however is compared to for the sni data peak cloud cover
occurs i hour earlier for the hbtm results the differences in the
cloud amounts may arise for several reasons cloud cover over the island
may not be representative of the larger area since the clouds generally
f not filmedpass over the island there may be some surface heating during the day which
affects the cloud deck during the night the local heating ceases
radiative cooling of the island is limited by the largescale cloud field so
that there should be little island effect at night sampling differences
may also affect the comparison a visual examination of the data using the
video imagery developed by d wylie and p grimm university of wisconsin
unpublished revealed that of the days the cloud cover over the
island and surrounding regions appeared to vary the same during only days
during of the days a vshaped clearing formed around and downwind of the
island during the afternoon during another days the regions surrounding
the island showed considerable clearing while a strip centered on the island
remained overcast the clouds cleared around the island and over the island
itself during the remaining days however the clouds cleared over the
island last in nearly all cases in the imagery the cloud cover over the
island and surrounding regions was very similar at the beginning of each day
during the ifo these visual findings are consistent with the means shown
in fig i and with sni time series of cloud amount the hbtm and sni
results show good agreement after midnight until sunrise faster and more
extensive clearing occurs around the island than over the island itself
this apparent island effect may also be responsible for the differences in
satellite and island cloudtop heights observed during the day minnis et
al 
a comparison of the satellite visible and sni broadband shortwave cloud
albedos is shown in fig the narrowband albedo is considerably lower
than the islandderived albedo values spectral differences sampling and
the atmospheric effects included in the satellite results are primarily
responsible for the differences to minimize the spectral differences the
visible albedos were converted to broadband shortwave albedos using an
empirical solarzenith angle dependent ratio the resulting albedos were
then corrected for atmospheric effects using the simple model of chen and
ohring since the clouds are so low it was assumed that they could
be treated like the surface the resulting cloud albedos derived from those
in fig are shown in fig cloud albedos were averaged without any
weighting by cloud amount for all cases with cloud amounts greater than i
the dashed line represents a mirror image of the morning satellite results
it is shown to demonstrate the sizable decrease in cloud albedo during the
afternoon despite the broadband and atmospheric corrections the sni cloud
albedos are still higher by on average if it is assumed that the sni
clouds are more like those over the surrounding regions when there is more
cloudiness then mean satellite cloud albedos derived by weighting the
albedo by the cloud fraction should be more similar to the sni results than
those derived using a simple averaging technique this approach was
implemented with the results shown in fig in this instance the mean
cloud albedo differences are only with greater errors near the
terminator as expected chen and ohring the remaining discrepancies
may be due to sampling and technique differences bidirectional reflectance
model biases and island effects though visual examination of albedo is
unreliable the clouds were distinctly brighter over the island than over
the adjacent areas during at least days july and an island effect
which results in more cloud cover may also alter the cloud composition
relative to the large scalethe lwc values derived from the sni microwave and solar measurements are
correlated with the satellite visible albedos in figs and 
respectively two curves are shown in each figure the lower curve which
levels at an albedo of is based on the results of coakley and snider
their regression is
ip lwc i
where p is the visible reflectance is the cosine of the solar zenith
angle and lwc is given in gm the second curve shown in these figures
is a regression fit to the observed data using the relationship
inl a blwc 
the cloud albedo is p x where x is an anisotropic reflectance
correction factor the coefficients a and b are and 
respectively for the microwave data the coefficients for the solar data
are a and b the curve for is tangential to the
knee of the curve for i the latter seems to fit the data well for lwc 
i gm but does not provide for any albedos greater than thus
the curve is unrealistic for higher values of albedo equation 
however shows no skill for matching the lower albedos but it allows for
additional increases in cloud albedos beyond it is concluded
therefore that a combination of these two functions would provide a more
complete representation of the relationship between albedo and lwc this
combination is accomplished by matching the curves at 
concluding remarks
it appears that the snlobserved clouds may be affected by the island
additional support for this thesis will require analysis of satellite data
over a small region centered on the instrument site accounting for these
potential effects the satellitederived cloud amounts and albedos are very
similar to those observed over sni the diurnal variations in cloud amount
and cloud albedo are also comparable to those seen over other areas eg
minnis and harrison these preliminary results have also provided a
relationship which may be utilized during the day to determine cloud lwc
over other parts of the ifo area
