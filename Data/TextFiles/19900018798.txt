graphiteepoxy panels with sglass buffer strips were tested in tension and shear to
measure their residual strengths with cracklike damage the buffer strips were regularly
spaced narrow strips of continuous sglass panels were made with a uniweave graphite
cloth where the sglass buffer material was woven directly into the cloth panels were made
with different width and thickness buffer strips the panels were loaded to failure while
remote strain strain at the end of the slit and crack opening displacement were monitored
the notched region and nearby buffer snips were radiographed periodically to reveal crack
growth and damage
except for panels with short slits the buffer strips arrested the propagating crack
the strength or failing strain of the panels was significantly higher than the strength of
allgraphite panels with the same length slit panels with wide thick buffer strips were
stronger than panels with thin narrow buffer strips a shearlag model predicted the failing
strength of tension panels with wide buffer snips accurately but overestimated the strength
of the shear panels and the tension panels with narrow buffer stripsintroduction

strips ahead of the arrested cracks which elevates the residual strength even more 
the buffer strip panels reported in were made using prepreg tape the manufac
turing cost was high because each strip of buffer material had to be individually placed into
the laminate the results reported in this paper are for panels made using a unidirectional
weave cloth these panels were much cheaper to manufacture because the buffer
materid was incorporated into the cloth using a textile weaving process thus no additional
labor was required to make the panel
the objective of this paper is to compare the strengths of panels made out of
uniweave cloth to those of panels made from prepreg tape also several panel configura
tions were investiglted which were not investigated in and a few panels were tested in
shear panel strengths are compared to predictions from a shear lag analysis ljnomenclature

buffer strips had the same crosssectional area of sglass but different widths and thick

facilitatedradiographicexaminationwhileunderloadresultsand discussion
theresultsof all tests are presented in table in terms of strain instead of stress so
that data can readily be compared for different laminates and test types the stressstrain
response of all the specimens was linear elastic so stress can be calculated by multiplying
strains times the elastic modulus reported in table i
tension panels
figure shows results which illustrate the basic behavior of the buffer strip panels
the fracture analysis curve is for the allgraphite laminate with no buffer strips and itcomes
from a fracture analysis for composites developed by poe see appendix the net swain
curve is an upper limit for failure representing notch insensitive behavior of the laminate
ie
the analysis by poe is based on linear elastic fracture mechanics and includes the effects of
laminate configuration and fiber ultimate swain typically the correlation between the
fracture analysis and experimental results from centernotched fracture coupons is excellent
for all laminates that do not develop large amounts of noncritical matrix damage at the
cracktips failing swains for laminates that exhibit large amounts of damage at the
cracktips are greater than the prediction because the damage acts to relieve the stress
concentrations in the fibers figure shows that the fracture analysis accurately
predicted the swain at which the cracks propagated in the buffer strip panels similar data
in and for buffer strip panels and fracture coupons all fell on or above the prediction
figure shows the fracture was not arrested by the buffer strips in the panel with
the mm slit and the panel failed at the fracture initiation strain the buffer strips arrested
the propagating crack in the panels with mm and mm slits the panels with arrested
cracks were then able to bear additional load and both failed at nearly the same farfieldstrainfigureshowsradiographsofthepanelwiththemmslit theradiographsshow

width buffer strips the panels with or had higher failing strains than panels withhb
the dominant parameter however was buffer strip width because the failing strain
ho
of panels with the thickest buffer strips was less than that of panels with the widest 
ram buffer strips finally the panels with buffer material in every ply failed at the highest
strain in fact the panels failed when the strain in the net section section taken parallel to
and through the crack reached the ultimate failing strain of a graphite ply
figure shows remote strain versus crack length data for the panels with buffer
material in every ply the panel with the mm sht failed with no arrest at the same strain
as the two panels which arrested interestingly the strains at which the fractures initiated
in the three panels are much higher than those predicted by the fracture analysis for the
panels with buffer material only in the plies fig fractures initiated at strains about
equal to those predicted by the analysis this suggests that the additional buffer strips
changed the stress state around the slits figure shows radiographs of a panel with buffer
strips in every ply the radiograph taken before initiation shows a large area of delamination
extending from the ends of the slit the radiograph taken after arrest shows an even larger
delamination area extending into the buffer strips the delaminations in this panel are much
larger than in the panels with buffer material in only the plies fig references and
showed that delamination increased the fracture strength of composite laminates by
reducing the stress concentration in the fibers near the end of the slit thus the higher strains
should be expected for fracture initiation in the panels with buffer strips in every ply due to
the large delaminations seen in the radiographs
remote strain plotted versus crack length is shown in figure for the ply tension
panels with mm wide buffer strips also shown for comparison are data from the 
ply panel with mm wide buffer strips the figure shows that the fracture initiation
strains and failing strains of the ply panels were slightly lower than those of the ply
panels also the fracture initiation strains for all the panels were very close to the strainpredictedbythefractureanalysisastudyofthicklaminatesshowedthatfracturestrains

damage in the buffer strip even though the shearlag model did not explicity model the

in after superposition of the tensile and compressive stresses
the analysis was developed using the principal of superposition for an infinite sheet
the shear stress on the panel was equivalent to the combined tension and compression stresses
shown in figure because the tensile and compressive stresses are uniaxial the total
strain in the ydirection in the shear panel is simply the sum of the ydirection strains in the
tension and compression panels thus the critical farfield longitudinal strain in the shear
panel is

where ey sthe critical farfield longitudinal strain in an infinite sheet loaded in uniaxial
tension perpendicular to the crack and iyp is the farfield longitudinal strain in an infinite
sheet loaded in compression parallel to the crack for specially orthotropic laminates with
ex ey the critical shear stress is related to the longitudinal strain by transforming the
extensional strains to the principal shear strain state and thus

finally using equation where ey f is the predicted farfield failing strain of an infinite
orthotropic sheet with a crack under uniaxial tendie load the curve in figure is
obtained
figure shows that the fracture initiation strains were below those predicted by the
analysis as mentioned previously data from tests usually fall above or on the prediction
data which coincides with the prediction ususally has little damage at the ends of the slit
data which falls below the prediction indicates that the specimens are failing by a different
mode or extrinsic loads for these panels the low fracture initiation stresses may be due to
outofplane deformation mode iii caused by the compressive stress parallel to the slit
the shear panels were constrained from buckling and test results showed that the
failing strain depended on the degree of constraint around the crack the two panels withthelowestfailing strainsfig hadconstraintplateswith cutoutsaroundtheslit and
adjacentbuffer stripsso that radiographs could be made under load the panel with the
highest failing strain had constraint plates with no cutouts observation during testing
suggested that once the crack had arrested the damage grew under additional load as a
local buckling failure in the unconstrained region and finally failed due to the compressive
stress figure shows a failed shear panel which was partially constrained the compres
sion failure started from the inside of the buffer strips adjacent to the slit progressed parallel
to the buffer strips in the unconstrained region and at failure propagated under the constraint
plates to the edge of the specimen failure of the fully constrained panels was similar except
there was no stable growth of damage parallel to the buffer strips the difference in the
damage of fully constrained and partially constrained panels suggests that the fully con
strained panels failed due to tensile fracture of the panel
figure compares measured failing strain from the shear tests with predicted failing
strain from the shearlag model the prediction was obtained by substituting the predicted
failing strain of a tension panel fig into equation the shearlag model which
accounted for damage in the buffer strip overpredicted the failing strain of the fully
constrained panels which suggests that there was less delamination and axial splitting in the
shear panels than in the tension panels figure shows radiographs of a tension and a shear
buffer strip panel with arrested cracks the radiographs were made near the failing strains
of the panels the radiograph of the tension panel shows that a delamination region has
formed over the entire width of the buffer strip as discussed earlier such damage reduces
the stress concentration in the fibers and elevates strength no such delamination region
developed in the buffer strips of the shear panel this indicates that the combined loading
suppressed the delamination growth in the buffer strip which of course reduced the strength
the failing strain of the s panels were much lower than the failing strains of

realistic thicknesses plies is mm shear panels may be fracture critical for larger slits
or damage panels are more likely to fail due to fracture in contrast a buffer strip panel is
more likely to fail due to buckling because the buffer strips elevate the fracture stress it
must be emphasized that an elastic buckling analysis was used to obtain figure and the
postbuckling behavior has not been taken into account postbuckling will alter the results
shown in the figure because the postbuckled panel strength is greater than the elastic
buckling stess
conclusions
the fracture behavior of buffer strip panels was studied the panels were made with
a uniweave graphite cloth where the sglass buffer strips were woven into the cloth panels
were tested in tension and shear specimens were loaded at a constant rate while farfield
strain strain in the buffer strips and cod were masured from the tests and a shearlag
model for buffer strip panels it was concluded thattension buffer strip panels made from uniweave graphite cloth had about the
same failing strain as panels made from prepreg tape the buffer strips arrested
the cracks and the failing strain or strength was much higher than the failing
strain of allgraphite panels with similar damage
buffer strip panels tested in shear arrested cracks like panels tested in tension
buffer strip geometry significantly affected the failing strain of panels with
arrested cracks panel strengths increase with both buffer strip width and buffer
strip thickness for panels with narrow buffer strips strain measurements
showed the panels failed when the strain in the graphite just beyond the buffer
strip reached the failing strain of graphite panels with wide buffer strips failed
when the buffer strips failed
panels with buffer material in every ply had the highest strength and were notch
insensitive net section stress equals the tensile ultimate strength
the shearlag model predicted the failing strain of tension panels with wide
buffer strips accurately the model overestimated the failing strain of tension
panels with narrow buffer strips because the failure mode in the panels was
different than the failure criterion used in the model the model overestimated
the failing strain of the shear panels also the discrepancy was attributed to the
size of the damage region in the buffer strips

abstract
graphiteepoxy panels with sglass buffer strips were tested in tension and shear to measure their residual
strengths with cracklike damage the buffer strips were regularly spaced narrow strips of continuous s
glass panels were made with a uniweave graphite cloth where the sglass buffer material was woven
directly into the cloth panels were made with different width and thickness buffer strips the panels wer
loaded to failure while remote strain strain at the end of the slit and crack opening displacement were
monitored the notched region and nearby buffer strips were radiographed periodically to reveal crack
growth and damage
except for panels with short slits the buffer strips arrested the propagating crack the strength or failing
strain of the panels was significantly higher than the strength of allgraphite panels with the same length
slit panels with wide thick buffer strips were stronger than panels with thin narrow buffer strips a
shearlag model predict the failing strength of tension panels with wide buffer strips accurately but over
estimated the strength of the shear panels and the tension panels with narrow buffer strips
