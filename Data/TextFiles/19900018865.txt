the principal features of the thermodynamic reglme of the
stratosphere are governed by the development of the winter strato
spheric low and the aleutian and atlantic heights these are fed
by the influx of the eddy energv transported into the stratosphere
by the planetary waves the intensity and variability of planetary
waves and vortices associated with the waves determine the
conditions of lowtohigh latitudes ozone transport in the winter
hemisphere note that the ozone distributions are zonally inhomo
geneous
figure shows the march and course of total ozone
to for the stations of leningrad voeikovo n e and
markovo n e and data of spring reversals d in ulian
dates time variations of to are out of phase at these stations
voeikovo lies within the area affected by the stratospheric polar
cyclonic vortex which blocks the inflow of ozone from low latitu
des markovo lies within the area affected by the aleutian high
which usually centres in temperate or subtropical latitudes the
circulation within this vortex stimulates latitudinal exchange
these two thermobaric systems form as a rule planetary waves
with zonal wave number n connections between to and planetary
waves variations are shown in figure figure presents the day
today course of to as observed at voeikovo during februarymarch
