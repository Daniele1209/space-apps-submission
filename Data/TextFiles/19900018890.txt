abstract the possioility to detect the comospheric flares
basedon the natural vlf emission intensity data on he arths
surface is considered diagnostics of the change of solar aray
burst flux at and its estimation are discussed as pos
sible
the effect of solar flare shortwave emission on the arths
ionosphere was considered oy aiitra where the determina
tion of solar xray fluxes by indirect mehods is described in
lowfrequency range for this aim are used the signals of transmit
ters operating at tenshundreds kilohertz xrequencies the records
of tne natural emlssion latmospherics are considered to be suit
able for the oetection of fares but to be hardly used for the in
vestigation of ionosphere physics as the detected noise represents
the integral effect of many sources and the sources are of a ran
dom character
here the possibility is studied of the deection of solar chro
mospheric flares and he estimation of aray flux acconanied by
powerful bursts in the range o i based on the change of
the regular noise background intensity of the natural lowfrequen
cy emission detected on the earth
for mn years in yakutsk n he naturl
lfvlf emission at i z is being detected coninlously one
of he types of continious lowfrequency emission is a regular
noise background ib determined as a separate class vrshinin

and is characterized by a smooth temporal rounding a spectral dis
tribution of idb intensity is two emission bands in elfvlf ranges

a comparison of pb rcords ith solar xray fluxes howed that
the chsnge of zlfvlf emission intensity and its value depend on
a value of xray burst flux almost simultsneously with solar xray

a dynamics of vi emission intensity at khz and of xray
ilux repeat each other in counterphase however lf emission in
tensit increase during a flare is not always observed and a fre
quency at which occurs a transfer from rnbintensity increase to
its decrease is rather variable besides flf emission intensity
enhancementcaused by the influence of enhanced solar xray flux
on the ionosphere is hardly different from elf emission flare caused
by other types of ionospheric and magnetospheric disturbances at
the sametime a sharp veakeningof b intensity at vlf frequencies
observed during chromospheric flares is opposite to lf emission
bursts and is of a characteristic for chromospheric flares form
therefore to study the variabions of solar xray fluxes were used
the experimental data at khz which besides appears to be at
frequency range here liib intensity weakening is maximumduring a
flare andpdb record level is high enoughas comparedwith the ins
trumen noise
ometimes during several hours one can observe a number of fla
re for instance on july the variations of idb level
caused by them are superposed on its regular daily changes never
theless see lig in the behaviour of pdbcurve is reflected
the dynamics of flare xray zlux a picture is being clarified if
to subtrack the daily variations of rnbintensity from the total
cuv e course
e carried out a statistical treatment of the experimental data
on a number of chromospheric flares and estimated solar xray flux
during flares in the case when xray fluxes f increase during
a flare by an order of or more they are as cffj 
here c and are determined based on the experimental data
the estimated xra flux in the first approximation is shown in
ig a comparison wibh the satellite data sgd evidences
ibs agreement
hue using ata of continious groundbased registration of the
natural vlf emission one can
on characteristic for he period of chromospheric flares form
of idb intensity oecrease of vlf emission to detect solar flares
ccoipanied y powerful solar xrays bursts
on bhe change of vlf emission inb intensity to carry out a
continious oiagnostics of changes of solar aray burst zlux and
to estimate its value
