introduction
when metallic structures operate at temperatures in excess of tin where
tm is the melting temperature of the metal it is generally observed that the
structure suffers timedependent deformation and eventually ruptures for components
made of highly creep resistant materials or where distortion is not a controlling
factor structural lifetime is often limited by creep rupture
in design practice estimates of creep deformation are often based on
generalizations of the classical norton creep law predictions of creep failure resulting
from material deterioration are frequently based on generalizations of the kachanov
 rabotnov damage law
 prof univ of akron akron oh 
 asstprof univ of akron akron oh 
 grad student univ of akron akron ohgeneralizations of these laws eg leckie and hayhurst lemaitre and
chaboche leckie have been proposed that account for multiaxial stress
and that employ damage evolutionary laws reflecting various micromechanisms ashby
and dyson these generalizations commonly employ concepts such as an
effective stress and an isochronous failure function or surface important conclusions
based on these formulations are that creep deformation rupture time and failure
strain all are influenced strongly by the multiaxial state of stress further they
conclude that damage evolves more or less anisotropically depending on the
mechanisms involved
the objective of this paper is to extend these results concerning creep and
creep damage to metals that are reinforced by strong unidirectional fibers the focus
is on reinforced structures where the fiber direction may vary from point to point
but that a single material fiber direction is identifiable locally viz local transverse
isotropy the strong fibers are assumed to suppress creep along their direction but
in the presence of general states of stress both creep and creep damage occurs
the representation of creep deformation follows earlier work concerning strongly
fiber reinforced metals robinson and duffy and binienda and robinson
 tensorial invariants identified in these works reflecting deviatoric stress
dependence and the appropriate material symmetry are adopted in the present flow
law as the emphasis here is on the interaction of creep and damage tertiary creep
the relatively small contribution of primary creep cfpetrasek and titran
grobstein ab is ignored
a major assumption here is that the stress dependence of damage evolution is
i on the maximum tensile stress normal to the local fiber direction and ii on the
maximum longitudinal shear stress ie the maximum shear stress on planes
containing the fibers and in a direction along the fibers it is postulated that the
effects of these stress components interact to damage the composite internally along
the fiber matrix interface eventually leading to creep rupture under this
idealization tensile stress along the fibers causes no creep and no damage tensile
stress however smal transverse to the fibers causes both creep deformation and
damage in reality stress along the fibers causes damage and leads to a finite
lifetime however the difference in damage rates and thus rupture times under
longitudinal and transverse stress generally exceeds an order of magnitude grobstein
a petrasek and titranstudies of creep damage of some monolithic alloys suggest that at lower stress
levels appropriate to engineering practice creep rupture occurs mainly by
intergranular void growth cocks and ashby in such cases void growth rates
at a particular grain boundary are controlled by diffusion mechanisms which in turn
are controlled by the maximum tensile stress transverse to the given grain boundary
hull and rimmer chuang and rice here we postulate that the
fibermatrix interface in a metallic composite plays a role on the mesostructural
scale analogous to that of grain boundaries on the microstructural scale thus at
high temperature and lower stress levels we anticipate that the maximum tensile
stress transverse to the fiber direction may strongly influence void growth at the
fibermatrix interface and consequently may correlate with a creep rupture
mechanism based on interfacial degradation through diffusion related void growth it
is expected that the diffusion mechanisms involved may include those known to
control void growth rates at grain boundaries as well as other mesomechanisms
observed to be present ifi metallic composite systems eg those leading to
phenomena such as kirkendall porosity or the evolution of an interphase grobstein
b as indicated earlier account is also taken of the contribution of longitudinal
shear stress to interfacial degradation these stress dependencies of damage evolution
are included by introducing invariants that correspond to the local maximum
transverse tension and longitudinal shear these invariants are taken as arguments of
an isochronous damage function cfleckie 
as the damage invariants depend on the local stress and material orientation
the rate of damage evolution is anisotropic thus rupture time and failure strain
depend similarly on fiber orientation the degree of damage is measured by a scalar
kachanov and thus does not reflect material directionality potentially this
may lead to inaccuracies in hfe prediction of structures subjected to highly
nonproportional loading it is expected that this will not seriously affect hfe
prediction of proportionally loaded structures eg pressure vessels cfho 
following the development of the creep creep rupture model experiments are
outlined for the determination of the material parameters and functions application
is then made to a simple structure ie a thin walled tubular pressure vesselthe creepcreep damage model
the form of the creep deformation damage model proposed by leckie and
tiayhurst is extended for metallic composites we consider hightemperature
isothermal conditions and a composite of given fiber volume percentage
generalization to nonisothermal conditions follows as in cocks and ponter 
extension to other fiber densities is possible by considering key material parameters
as functions of fiber volume percentage
invariants identified in robinson and duffy and binienda and robinson
 are adopted to account for material directionality local transverse isotropy
as earlier an orientation tensor
dij didj 
is introduced where di are the components of a unit vector denoting the
local fiber direction the invariants i and i are defined as cf robinson and
duffy

 s the maximum transverse shear stress

these invariants enter the model through two functions qbaiidij the flow
potential function and aaijdij the isochronous failure function guided by
binienda and robinson we take qb as
 o jj i 
where ao is a reference stress to be defined subsequently consistent with the
discussion in the previous section the function a is taken to depend on the
invariants jr and the surface a in the space will be
termed the isochronous failure surface a specific functional form of a for a given
material must be determined by experiment possible experiments for this purpose
might employ reinforced thinwailed tubes of the composite of interest subjected to
combined tension torsion and pressure as pertinent experimental results are not
available currently here in the interest of simplicity we adopt a linear form figl

for the limiting case of isotropy the creep creep rupture model expressed in

the constant is referred to as the creep damage tolerance in the literature on
creep of monolithic alloys cf leckie in effect a measures the ability of
the metal to withstand local straining at points of high strain concentration in a
structure in design practice it is desirable that a 
now we consider an arbitrary transverse tensile stress a not equal to the
reference stress ao for eq then reduces to a simple norton power
law with the constants ao and eo known and data pairs a measured from
the early stages of a set of transverse creep rupture tests an optimal value of the
exponent n can be determined

the simple structure considered in this section is not of essential practical
importance but serves as an illustrative example of the dependence of tf and f
or equivalently an effective creep damage tolerance fef on the
multiaxial biaxial stress state and on the fiber orientation in a general design
situation we may want to maximize both tf and ef or ie we may want a
long structural lifetime and a large tolerance to local straining at possible strain
concentrations in our present example we see by comparing figs and that these
maxima do not always occur at a common fiber angle suggesting the necessity
of a design compromise in the selection of the optimal fiber orientation it is
intended that the simple model presented here may provide guidance for the
practicing structural engineer in making such design considerations
summary and conclusions
a creep and creep damage model is presented for metallic composites with
strong fibers the intended applications are reinforced structures in which the fiber
direction may vary throughout but a single fiber direction can be identified locally
local transverse isotropythe representation of creepdeformation follows earlier work and includes a flow
potential function that depends on invariants reflecting the local stress and
material orientation as the focus is on the interaction of creep and damage the
relatively minor role of primary creep is ignored
the creep rupture model is a generalization of classical continuum damage
mechanics and includes an isochronous damage function a taken to depend on
invariants specifying the maximum tensile stress normal to the local fiber direction
and the maximum longitudinal shear stress these stress components are assumed to
damage the composite at the fibermatrix interface eventually causing creep rupture
it is conjectured that at high temperature and low stress the fibermatrix interface
plays a role on the mesostructural scale analogous to grain boundaries on the
microstructural scale an anisotropic damage mechanism is posited where interfacial
degradation occurs through diffusion and hence stress controlled void growth eg
kirkendall void growth
a procedure is outlined for the determination of the several material parameters
on the basis of creep rupture testing under transverse tension additional testing is
required to determine the functional dependence and form of the isochronous damage
function here a linear form is assumed requiring a limited number of creep rupture
tests under longitudinal shear
general results are obtained for the time to failure tf and the final effective
failure strain f under constant multiazial stress each is found to depend not only
on stress but on fiber orientation thus for a given stress state the model permits
the selection ofa fiber orientation that may optimize tf andor f according to a
relevant design criterion
the theory is applied to a thinwalled tubular pressure vessel with strong fibers
at an arbitrary helical angle the quantities tf and f are calculated for the thin
tube as functions of fiber angle as anticipated the rupture time tf is a
maximimum for circumferential reinforcement of the tube depending on the relative
strength of the contributions of transverse tension and longitudinal shear to the
evolution of damage viz the form of the isochronous damage function a tf
may reach a minimum at an intermediate fiber angle fig the effective final
strain f can achieve a maximum or a minimum at an intermediate angle again
depending on the relative importance of transverse tensile and longitudinal sheardamagefig in general simultaneous optimization of tf and f results in a
design compromise
the example problem illustrates the potential usefulness of the proposed model
as a means of realizing optimal designs of composite structures where creep and creep
rupture are life limiting of course the accuracy of predictions made using the theory
depends intimately on the forms of the functions and a and on the material
constants correct choices of these functions and parameters for a given composite
material rest on careful experimentation some experimental justification for the
choice of qb is provided in binienda and robinson however the functional
dependence and form of the isochronous damage function a is largely conjectural
particularly the linear form adopted here and must be verified on the basis of
detailed phenomenological and microstructural observation key verification
experiments are currently being defined
